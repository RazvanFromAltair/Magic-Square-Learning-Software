# Magic-Square-Learning-Software
# Written by Colin Beatty [cabeatty@oakland.edu]
Goals:
1)   Design and implement the algorithms necessary for generating any NxN magic square.  Will accept user input for size  determination (The algorithms are recursive, so I will put a cap on the allowed size to avoid stack overflow).
2)   Design and implement a step by step visualization of how the software solves such a magic square.  (Shows how we order the numbers in the matrix in a visual way, one number at a time)
3)   Write a step by step walk through of how one would go about solving an NxN magic square.  Implement it in a way such that it corresponds to the visualization. 
4)   Provide a preface before the actual walk through describing what a magic square actually is.

The point of this software is simple; provide a clear and consise definition of magic squares, and explain how one might go about creating/solving one themselves.  Learning utility intended to teach individuals about mathematical magic squares.
